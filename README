  Story
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 In the distant future, a monster has been wrecking havoc through the galaxy. No
known weapon seems to hurt it. All beings live in fear of the creature's next
attack.
 But two adventurers, fearing nothing but boredom and the lack of danger,
decided to fight back!
 They went back in time and into the monster's lair, to destroy it before it
could become a threat!

================================================================================
  About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 JJAT is a precision platformer with a few inspiration from metroidvania games
(except it turned out really short...). You play as two characters exploring a
facility, looking for a way to defeat a monster.
 The game can be played alone, using the left stick and left shoulder buttons to
control one character and using the "right side" of the controller to control
the other character. There are bindings for keyboard, but a gamepad should be
used, if possible.
 The game can also be played by two people. This make somethings easier, as its
not necessary to control two characters at once, but add a new layer of
complexity, since both players need to be in sync and cooperate.

================================================================================
  Controls
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The controls can be checked and modified on the 'options' menu.

================================================================================
  Dependencies
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To run this game, you must have SDL2 installed on your system.
Simply install it from apt-get and it should work:

  $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-2.0.0

If that doesn't work, try using the develpment package:

  $ sudo apt-get install libsdl2-dev
